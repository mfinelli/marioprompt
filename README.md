# marioprompt

I've used [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) for many
years now and am quite happy with it, however it has been put into maintenance
mode (with the warning the bugs will go unfixed...) and so I started looking
for alternatives. The most promising option that I saw is probably 
[starship](https://starship.rs) but I like the way that my PL10K prompt looks
and I couldn't make starship behave the same way. I've also wanted to give
[fish](https://fishshell.com) (another) try for a while now, so I've decided
to see if I can just build my own prompt that does what I want and not what I
don't.
